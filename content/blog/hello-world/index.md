 > The term has been in use since the 1990s, with some giving credit to 
 > John Mashey for popularizing the term.[15][16] Big data usually includes 
 > data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly used software tools 
 > to capture, curate, manage, and process data within a tolerable elapsed 
 > time.[17] Big data philosophy encompasses unstructured, semi-structured 
 > and structured data, however the main focus is on unstructured data.[18] 
 > Big data "size" is a constantly moving target, as of 2012 ranging from a 
 > few dozen terabytes to many zettabytes of data.[19] Big data requires a 
 > set of techniques and technologies with new forms of integration to reveal 
 > insights from data-sets that are diverse, complex, and of a massive scale.[20]
